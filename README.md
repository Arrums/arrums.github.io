# Arrum Soerjo's Website Portfolio

This is an ongoing project of my website portfolio. The website has a responsive
design to mobile, tablet, and computer screen sizes.

## Goals

Creating a website that utilise the knowledge that I gained through \_nology
Tech Consultancy program. Once I have finished learning Javascript, I will
include this to the website.

Initially it was quite difficult implementing media query as I have to update
the layout depending on the screen size. However after putting more time on this
project, I felt more comfortable creating a responsive layout.

## Technology used in this project
